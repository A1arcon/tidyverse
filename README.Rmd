# tidyverse

The goal of tidyverse is to make it easy to install and load multiple tidyverse packages in a single command.

## Installation

You can install tidyverse from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/tidyverse")
```

This will also install tidyverse packages `r comma(tidyverse:::tidyv_packages(FALSE))`.

## Usage

Use `library(tidyverse)` to automatically load the tidyverse packages you are likely to use in almost every analysis: `r comma(tidyverse:::load)`. You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you have loaded:

```{r example}
library(tidyverse)
```
