# Summary

![](tidyverse-logo.png)

At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code [@R-core]. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. 

The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command.

This paper describes the tidyverse package, the components of the tidyverse, and some of the underlying design principles. This is a lot of ground to cover in a brief paper, so we focus on a 50,000 foot view showing how all the pieces fit together with copious links to more detailed resources. 

# Tidyverse package

The tidyverse is a collection of packages that can easily be installed with a single "meta"-package, which called "tidyverse". This provides a convenient way of downloading and installing all tidyverse packages with a single R command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The core tidyverse includes the packages that you're likely to use in everyday data analyses, and these are attached when you attach the tidyverse package:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

As of tidyverse version 1.2.0, the core packages include dplyr [@R-dplyr], forcats [@R-forcats], ggplot2 [@ggplot2], purrr [@R-purrr], readr [@R-readr], stringr [@R-stringr], tibble [@R-tibble], and tidyr [@R-tidyr]. Using `library(tidyverse)` ensures that the packages are attached in the correct order, and provides a concise summary of namespace conflicts. 

<!--  JH: Firstly, attaching the tidyverse R package will ensure that tidyverse packages are attached in the correct order. This is not trivial for beginners (e.g. attaching the plyr and dplyr R packages in the incorrect order will cause issues). Secondly, attaching the tidyverse R package will inform the user about namespace conflicts in a concise and informative manner. This is very useful when many tidyverse and non-tidyverse packages are attached. -->
<!-- MGA: I want to take care of the above with LD comment below -->
<!-- Discussing the pros and cons of using the "tidyverse" package versus loading individual packages would be useful. It is stated that the "tidyverse" is intended for the general workflow of a data project. However, it might be worth mentioning that it probably is not ideal for using as a dependency in package development. I'm sure there are other examples and issues that should be considered. -->

<!-- Is the tidyverse R package not a core tidyverse package? It is not listed as a core package in Line 129. Maybe it would be useful to explicitly state if the tidyverse R package is a core package or not? --> 
<!-- MGA re. above: This would make the tidyverse like recursively core...clearly we're not describing it well, but I'm not sure how to clarify -->

<!-- Line 131: I wonder if it is worth listing all of the non-core packages in the tidyverse? -->
<!-- MGA I tried the above as a parenthetical-- too long --seems unnatural here-->

Non-core packages are installed with `install.packages("tidyverse")`, but are not attached by `library(tidyverse)`. They play more specialised roles, so will be attached by the analyst as needed. The non-core packages are: blob [@R-blob], glue [@R-glue], googledrive [@R-googledrive], haven [@R-haven], hms [@R-hms], lubridate [@R-lubridate], magrittr [@R-magrittr], modelr [@R-modelr], readxl [@R-readxl], reprex [@R-reprex], and rvest [@R-rvest].

The tidyverse package is designed for interactive use, and should not be imported for package-development purposes. The `tidyverse_deps()` function returns a tibble of the package's dependencies. Its one argument, `recursive`, can be set to `TRUE` to include the dependencies of the tidyverse packages--totalling 87, as of this writing. We recommend that package developers import, suggest, or depend on component packages.

# Components

How do the component packages of the tidyverse fit together? We use the model of data science tools from "R for Data Science" [@r4ds]:

![](data-science.png)

Every analysis starts with data __import__: if you can't get your data into R, you can't do data science on it! Data import takes data stored in a file, database, or through a web application programming interface (API), and reads it into a data frame in R. Data import is supported by the core [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) [@R-readr] package for flat files (like csv, tsv, and fwf). 
<!-- Lines 139 and 141: It appears that the term "data" is being used to refer to a singular entity, though some would argue that the term "data" is a plural. I do not know the grammar rules to which this journal subscribes, so I thought I would raise this point just in case. --->

Additional non-core packages, such as [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org) [@R-readxl], [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org) [@R-haven], [googledrive](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/) [@R-googledrive], and [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) [@R-rvest], make it possible to import data stored in other common formats or directly from the web.

<!-- Line 139 and elsewhere: The manuscript contains many embedded links which mean that URLs are not shown in the text (e.g. like this). I am not familiar enough with the correct reference style for this journal, so I thought I would raise this point just in case. -->
<!-- MGA response: I think we do this consistently with citations to the packages, which also give the pkgdown URLs -->

Next, we recommend that you __tidy__ your data, getting it into a consistent form that makes the rest of the analysis easier. Most functions in the tidyverse work with tidy data [@tidy-data], where every column is a variable, every row is an observation, and every cell contains a single value. If your data is not already in this form (almost always!), the core [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) [@R-tidyr] package provides tools to tidy it up.

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Ensure pkgdown links to the right packages.
library(dplyr)
```

Data __transformation__ is supported by the core [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) [@R-dplyr] package. dplyr provides verbs that work with whole data frames, such as `mutate()` to create new variables, `filter()` to find observations matching given criteria, and `left_join()` and friends to combine multiple tables. dplyr is paired with packages that provide tools for specific column types: 

* [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org) for strings.
* [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org) for factors, R's categorical data 
  type.
* [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org) [@R-lubridate] for dates and 
  date-times.
* [hms](https://hms.tidyverse.org/) [@R-hms] for clock times.

There are two main tools for understanding data: __visualisation__ and __modelling__. The tidyverse provides the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) [@ggplot2] package for visualisation. ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics [@wilkinson2005].
<!-- References: The reference for Bache & Wickham (2014) has a lower case "r" in the title when referring to the R programming language. -->

You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details. Modelling is outside the scope of this paper, but is part of the closely affiliated [tidymodels](https://github.com/tidymodels) [@R-tidymodels] project, which shares interface design and data structures with the tidyverse.

Finally, you'll need to communicate your results to someone else. __Communication__ is one of the most important parts of data science, but is not included within tidyverse. Instead, we expect people will use other R packages, like [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) [@R-rmarkdown] and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) [@R-shiny], which support dozens of static and dynamic output formats.

Surrounding all these tools is __programming__. Programming is a cross-cutting tool that you use in every part of a data science project. Programming tools in the tidyverse include:

* [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) [@R-purrr], which enhances R’s
  functional programming toolkit.

* [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) [@R-tibble], which provides
  a modern re-imagining of the venerable data frame, keeping what time has
  proven to be effective, and throwing out what it has not. 

* [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) [@R-reprex], which helps 
  programmers get help when they get stuck by easing the creation of 
  reproducible examples.

* [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org) [@R-magrittr], which provides 
  the pipe, `%>%`, used throughout the tidyverse. The pipe is a tool for
  function composition, making it easier to solve large problems by breaking 
  them into small pieces.

# Design principles

We are still working to explicitly describe the unifying principles that make the tidyverse consistent, but you can read our latest thoughts at <https://design.tidyverse.org/>. There is one particularly important principle that we want to call out here: the tidyverse is fundamentally __human centred__. That is, the tidyverse is designed to support the activities of a human data analyst, so to be effective tool builders, we must explicitly recognise and acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of human cognition.

This is particularly important for R, because it’s a language that’s used primarily by non-programmers, and we want to make it as easy as possible for first-time and end-user programmers to learn the tidyverse. We believe deeply in the motivations that lead to the creation of S: "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully" [@programming-with-data]. This means that we spend a lot of time thinking about interface design, and have recently started experimenting with [surveys](https://github.com/hadley/table-shapes) to help guide interface choices. 

Similarly, the tidyverse is not just the collection of packages --- it is also the community of people who use them. We want the tidyverse to be a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community. We are still developing our skills in this area, but our existing approaches include active use of Twitter to [solicit feedback](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/948722811232751617), announce updates, and generally listen to the community. We also keep users apprised of major upcoming changes through the [tidyverse blog](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/), run [developer days](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/08/tidyverse-developer-day/), and support lively discussions on [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com).

# Acknowledgments

The tidyverse would not be possible without the immense work of the [R-core team](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html) who maintain the R language and we are deeply indebted to them. We are also grateful for the financial support of [RStudio, Inc](https://www.rstudio.com/).
