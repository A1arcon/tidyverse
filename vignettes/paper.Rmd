# Introduction

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

The tidyverse is a language for solving data-science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate the conversation that a human has with a dataset.
All packages in the tidyverse share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures, with the aim that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next.
<!--- MA: "conversation" in quotes, perhaps? --->

The scope of the tidyverse covers the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project, including data import, wrangling, and visualisation. We expect that almost every project will use multiple packages from outside of the tidyverse: the goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges, not to solve every possible problem. In particular, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication with others. These are both critical for data science projects, but big enough domains that they merit separate treatment.

This paper describes the tidyverse package, the components of the tidyverse, and some of the underlying philosophy.

# Tidyverse package

As well as a being a collection of packages, the tidyverse itself is also a package, which provides a convenient way of downloading all tidyverse packages with a single R command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The core tidyverse includes the packages that you're likely to use in everyday data analyses, and these are loaded when you load the tidyverse:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

As of tidyverse 1.2.0, the core packages include ggplot2 [@ggplot2], dplyr [@R-dplyr], tidyr [@R-tidyr], readr [@R-readr], purrr [@R-purrr], tibble [@R-tibble], stringr [@R-stringr], and forcats [@R-forcats]. Non-core packages are installed with `install.packages("tidyverse")`, but are not loaded with `library(tidyverse)`. They typically play more specialised roles, so need to be loaded individually, as needed.

# Components

The tidyverse packages are introduced and used throughout "R for Data Science" [@r4ds], which uses the following model of the tools for most data science projects:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("data-science.png")
```

First, you must __import__ your data into R. This typically means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web API, and load it into a data frame in R. If you can't get your data into R, you can't do data science on it! Data import is supported by the core [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) [@R-readr] package for flat files (like csv, tsv, and fwf). Additional non-core packages, such as [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org) [@R-readxl], [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) [@R-rvest], and [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org) [@R-haven], support data stored in other ways.

We recommend that you __tidy__ your data, getting it into a consistent form that makes the rest of the analysis easier. In a tidy data frame [@tidy-data] every column is a variable, every row is an observation, and each cell contains a single value. The [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) [@R-tidyr] package helps you tidy data, getting it into a form that other tidyverse packages work with.

Next comes the __transform__ step. Data transformation is supported by the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) [@R-dplyr] package, which provide verbs that support the most common data frame manipulations. Other packages provide tools for specific types of data: 

* [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org) for strings.
* [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org)) for factors, R's data type of
  categorical values.
* [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org) [@R-lubridate] for 
  dates and date-times.
* [hms](https://hms.tidyverse.org/) [@R-hms] for clock times.

Next, you'll gain understanding of your data by __visualising__ and __modelling__ it. [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics [@wilkinson2005]. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details [@ggplot2]. Modelling is outside the scope of this paper, but is part of the closely affiliated [tidymodels](https://github.com/tidymodels) [@R-tidymodels] project, which shares its underlying design and data structures with the tidyverse  

Finally, you'll need to communicate your results to someone else. __Communication__ is extremely important parts of data science, but is not included within tidyverse. Instead, we expect people will use other R packages, like [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) [@R-rmarkdown] and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) [@R-shiny], which support dozens of static and dynamic output formats.

Surrounding all these tools is __programming__. Programming is a cross-cutting tool that you use in every part of the project. Programming tools in the tidyverse include:

* [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) [@R-purrr], which enhances R’s
  functional programming toolkit.

* [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) [@R-tibble], which provides
  a modern re-imagining of the venerable data frame, keeping what time has
  proven to be effective, and throwing out what it has not. 

* [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) [@R-reprex], which helps 
  programmers get help when they get stuck by easing the creation of 
  reproducible examples.

* [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org) [@R-magrittr], which provides 
  the pipe, `%>%`, used throughout the tidyverse. The pipe is a tool for
  function composition, making it easier to solve large problems by breaking 
  them into small pieces.

# Philosophy

We are still working to explicitly describe the unifying principles that make the tidyverse so consistent, and you can read our latest thoughts at <https://principles.tidyverse.org/>. But there is one very important principle that is worth calling our here: the tidyverse is fundamentally human centered. In other words, the tidyverse is designed to support the activities of a human data analyst. So, to be effective tool builders, we must explicitly recognise and acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of humans.

This is particularly important for R, because it’s a language that’s used primarily by non-programmers, and we want to make it as easy as possible for first-time and end-user programmers to learn the tidyverse. This means that we spend a lot of time thinking about interface design, and have recently started experimenting with [surveys](https://github.com/hadley/table-shapes) to help guide interface choices.

Similarly, the tidyverse is not just the collection of packages -- it is also the community of people who use them. We want the tidyverse to be a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community. We are still developing our skills in this area, but our existing approaches include active outreach on twitter, keeping users apprised of major upcoming changes through the [tidyverse blog](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/), running [developer days](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/08/tidyverse-developer-day/), and an active community on [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com).
